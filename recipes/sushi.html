            <li>3 Cups of Water</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup of Rice Vinegar</li>

            <li>5 Sheets of Nori Seaweed</li>
            <li>1 Avocado, <strong>Sliced</strong></li>
            <li>1/2 Cucumber, <strong>Sliced</strong></li>
            <li>1/2 Pound of Imitation Crab Meat, <strong>Shredded</strong></li>
            <li>Soy Sauce and Wasabi for Serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Step-By-Step Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the sushi rice until the water runs clear. In a large saucepan, combine the rice and water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 18-20 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the water has been absorbed.</li>
            <li>In a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Heat over low heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar has dissolved.</li>
            <li>Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a large mixing bowl. Gradually add the vinegar mixture to the rice, stirring gently to combine. Let the rice cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Place a sheet of nori seaweed on a sushi mat, shiny side down. Spoon about 1/2 cup of rice onto the nori, using wet hands to spread it evenly. Leave a 1-inch border at the top of the nori.</li>
            <li>Place the avocado, cucumber, and crab meat in a line across the center of the rice. Use the sushi mat to roll the sushi into a tight cylinder, starting from the bottom and using the border at the top to seal the roll.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining ingredients, making 5 sushi rolls in total.</li>
            <li>Use a sharp knife to slice the sushi rolls into 8 pieces each. Serve with soy sauce and wasabi.</li>
